# Racist
This is a script that checks the language of joining players and punishes them if their language is selected. It is designed for use with the "Stand" GTA mod menu.

## Description
Are you feeling a bit xenophobic? or do you just not like a specific language so bad that you need to punish everyone who uses it?

Well this could be the right script for you! Racist! is a script that checks the language of joining players and punishes them if their language is selected.

The punishment format is a command or several if you chain them, by default it is a kick. If you are setting a custom punishment please note that the player's name is replaced with "@name" by default (change inside the script) to allow more freedom.
